# Starship game
Made with Unity\
2020.3.17f1 version\
A 2.5D simple obstacle game with basic physics. Figuring out player movement was most tricky part for it to feel smooth and good to control. Additionally I played with basic object movement and physics, like some falling debree when player is close enough. For now game has only 3 levels but it might change in the future.Â
